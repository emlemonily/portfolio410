                    <p>My high school held an annual competition between grades called "Winter Olympics." One component of this competition involves a massive hallway decorating contest with incredibly complex artistic designs for each grade. I directed two years (2019-2020) of these immersive art installations and was voted MVP senior year by my grade for my leadership and production of the design.</p>

                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="row-case-studies alt-colors2">
                    <p>To win points for our grade, my objective was to create a competitive piece that reflected the assigned theme for our grade (Junior year: Candyland; Senior Year: Monster’s Inc.). We had about 2-3 weeks to prepare, planning the design and creating the art pieces within that time period. The day of the competition, we had only 2 hours to actually arrange our immersive designs in a space of about 50+ feet.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="row-case-studies alt-colors2">
                    <p>As the lead hallway design coordinator for my grade, I was responsible for managing a team of 10+ artists and 50+ volunteers to create and install the finished product.</p>
                    <p>During the preparation time, I held brainstorming sessions and after school workshops to create our art pieces. Senior year, we divided up the hallway into smaller sections and then had different artists responsible for the overall design of their section. This allowed us to get more complex and more story-driven, dividing up our hallway into different bedrooms each paired with a different Monster’s Inc. character.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the creative leadership, I was also largely responsible for coordinating the materials needed for the project. I created a master document of the needed supplies from volunteers as well as the needed donations of household items. Using donations and my own funds, I also purchased the necessary supplies to support our after school workshops.</p>
                    <p>On the date of the installation, we had a two-hour session to put up the decorations in the hallway to create an immersive, competitive experience. I lead the efforts for this, delegating tasks to 50+ volunteers on a massive time crunch.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies alt-colors2">
                    <p>For my senior year, we won the entire competition and my classmates voted me as “Winter Olympics MVP” for our yearbook superlatives. In terms of what I specifically created, my main artistic contributions consisted of drawing paper murals for the hallway walls and creating large character cut-outs.</p>
                    <p>Junior year, I created two full-length wall murals of Candyland characters and scenery. Senior year, I was responsible for the design production of the entire entrance section, including a Sully cut-out, “Seniors” photo wall, a variety of other character cut-outs, and over a hundred small cardboard doors with the name of each student in our grade for them to take as a memory of the event.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies alt-colors2">
                    <p>From this experience, I gained substantial experience with art direction and project management. Comparing our efforts from Junior to Senior year, I learned the value of dividing up the creative work and delegating it to different artists in order to maximize our output and creativity. I also learned the importance of behind-the-scenes leadership, which included my efforts to gather supplies and establish after school workshops that built a welcoming environment for people to contribute to the final product.<p>

                    <p>As a part of my job as Communications Website Editor Intern for WKAR, I had a chance to write an article showcasing a documentary preview screening and discussion for the new documentary, <i>American Exile</i>, directed by MSU film professor John J. Valadez. <i>American Exile</i> highlights the stories of Manuel and Valente Valenzuela, two Mexican-American brothers who are decorated Vietnam veterans. Over the past several years, they have been tirelessly fighting against deportation notices for themselves and thousands of other American veterans at risk for deportation.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies alt-colors2">
                    <p>While attending this film screening, my objective was to accurately capture the emotions in the room that evening and translate them into a powerful piece to spread awareness about the story of the Valenzuela brothers. As a station news post, I was asked to create a synopsis of the event along with quotes from the discussion and direct one-on-one interviews with members of the discussion panel.<p>

                    <p>On Veterans Day (November 11, 2022), I attended the film screening and discussion as a press member for WKAR. To help me construct an article, I took notes on the film and recorded the audio of the following discussion. Afterwards, I interviewed some of the panelists about the event, which included John J. Valadez (MSU professor and the director of the film),  Susi Elkins, (Director of Broadcasting and General Manager at WKAR) and Prabu David (Dean of the College of Communication Arts and Sciences).</p>
                    <p>After gathering my audio content, I had to sort through and transcribe the recorded quotes to gather the best ones for the article. Once I had gathered a ton of useful quotes, I started to craft the story around what was said. I played with different arrangements of who could best introduce the overall event, along with deciding which quotes could be eliminated as the focus of the story was narrowed down.</p>
                    <p>As I continued working on my first draft, I hit about 1,000 words. However, as the editing process began, I learned from my supervisors that 700-800 words was ideal for this type of station news post. They provided me with a few other edits alongside encouraging me to cut down my word count.</p>

                    <p>After a bit of a learning curve, I finally created my first published article. My article was also featured on WKARâ€™s homepage and in their weekly newsletter.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies alt-colors2">
                    <p>Prior to this station news post, I had never written a journalistic style article. My writing has been primarily academically based, although I have been expanding my skills at my internship and my major. It was significantly different from what I have experience writing, so I really had to get used to organizing my writing in a different manner for a different audience. It was a welcomed challenge that allowed me to get outside of my comfort zone and push the boundaries of my skill set.</p>
                    <p>I also gained some truly valuable experience conducting interviews. I was originally very intimidated going into this article, especially since I had to interview some remarkable people at MSU. I tried to combat some of this fear by taking the time to write quality interview questions so that I would feel more confident speaking with my interviewees. Once I actually was able to speak with them and ask questions, I felt very welcomed and encouraged by their words.</p>

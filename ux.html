                    <p>As the final project for XA 242 (Fall 2021), my group and I created a portfolio of design work for <a href="https://arepr.org/" target="_blank">AREPR</a>, a digital archival project for emergency responses based in Puerto Rico. Their documentation comes in the aftermath of devastating hurricanes in Puerto Rico over the last several years. As students, we were asked to evaluate their current web presence and create a website redesign, style guide, and social media strategy.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies">
                    <p>Out of our tasks, I was largely responsible for handling the mockup for the redesign of their website. My objective was to create a visually powerful, yet easily accessible website to be used as a resource for Spanish/English-speaking people with different bandwidth capabilities.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies">
                    <p> As a part of the website redesign, I invoked many elements of the UX design process (research, wireframes, mockups). I began my work with a content inventory, a lengthy cataloging process that involved exploring every item of content that AREPR had on their current site. This research informed the wireframe stages, which allowed me to think about ways the information could be alternatively presented in order to meet my objective.</p>
                    <p> From this process, I created paper lo-fi wireframes, which I then translated onto Figma into a digital <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/lpHp5bWfeEoY122t1X8IKl/XA-242---AREPR---Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">lo-fi wireframe</a> environment. While I was working on the website redesign, my group members and I were also exploring design elements, including color, typography, photography, etc. I used these group decisions to inform my creation of the eventual website mockup, combining my layout and structure with our design elements.</p>

                <div class="row-case-studies">
                    <p>My finished product included a Figma website mockup of six different pages complete with the redesigned structure and design elements (indicated in our <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAExOJI874M/Ru0AW0IqXaA1S6bAr-eI2A/view?utm_content=DAExOJI874M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton" target="_blank">style guide</a>). We presented our deliverables in a presentation to AREPR’s project director, Christina Boyles.</p>

                    <p>As one of my first times completing the entire UX design process for a website, I learned about balancing the client’s needs with our design vision. We had to create something both visually appealing and functional, criteria that were sometimes a challenge to merge the creative work of each member into my final website mockup. This experience also helped me value each step of the design process as critical pieces to a finished product.</p>

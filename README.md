# portfolio410
## My goal for this website was to create a detailed, reflective portfolio of my work and my personality. For the organization, I decided to split my content into three main pages: Home, Resume, and Projects. Within the Projects tab, I showcased three separate projects, each in a different category: UX, Visuals, and Writing. Given my interests and my double majors, I wanted my case studies to accurately reflect me and my work. I wanted to avoid purely showcasing UX projects and instead expand to include more of my projects in other realms. Hopefully, in the future, I could maintain this website and continue adding case studies in their respective sections.
## In terms of the design aspects, I wanted to choose fonts, colors, images, etc. that reflected how I present myself. I am generally a fairly colorful person, who enjoys happy, bright colors in my life. My favorite color is coral (orange-pink), so I wanted to represent a variation of that as the main color of the website. I also think bright colors and cute characters (like my logo) are very welcoming, especially for a wide age-range. In the future, I hope to pursue some level of work that includes educational design or interactive learning, so I hope this helps me stand out in those aspects. I chose the typography because my handwriting looks somewhat similar to Lato and Oleo Script.
